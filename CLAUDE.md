# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Spacefall** is a 2D game built with Godot 4.6 using the Mobile rendering method. The project uses Jolt Physics for 3D physics calculations.

## Project Configuration

- **Engine**: Godot 4.6
- **Rendering**: Mobile renderer
- **Physics**: Jolt Physics engine (3D)
- **Platform**: Mobile-focused (config features: "4.6", "Mobile")
- **Windows Rendering**: D3D12 driver

## Development Commands

Note: Godot may not be in the system PATH. You may need to use the full path to the Godot executable or open the project through the Godot editor GUI.

### Opening the Project
```bash
# Open in Godot editor (if godot is in PATH)
godot --editor .

# Or use the full path to Godot executable
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --editor .
```

### Running the Game
```bash
# Run the project
godot --path .

# Run with specific scene
godot --path . main.tscn
```

## Project Structure

- **main.tscn**: Main scene (currently minimal Node2D root)
- **ship.tscn**: Ship scene with sprite (references resources/ship-001.png)
- **resources/**: Asset directory containing sprites and other resources
- **.godot/**: Generated editor files (ignored in git)

## Scene Architecture

The project uses Godot's scene tree architecture:
- Scenes are defined in `.tscn` files (text-based scene format)
- Scripts (when added) should be in `.gd` files using GDScript
- Resources are referenced using `res://` paths

Currently the project has:
- A minimal main scene (Node2D root)
- A ship scene with a Sprite2D node displaying ship-001.png texture

## Working with Godot Files

- **Scene files (.tscn)**: Text-based scene format. Avoid manual editing when possible; use the Godot editor
- **GDScript files (.gd)**: Can be edited directly or through the Godot editor's script editor
- **Import files (.import)**: Auto-generated by Godot for assets; do not edit manually
- **project.godot**: Main project configuration; edit through editor or manually with caution

## File Naming Conventions

- Scene files: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `ship.tscn`)
- Resource files: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `ship-001.png`)
- Script files: Should match node/class names when added
